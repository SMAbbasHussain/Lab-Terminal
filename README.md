This project is for an attraction-based platform, where visitors can explore various attractions and share their experiences.

Visitor Management: Visitors can register with their name and email. Each visitor has a list of attractions they've visited, which is used to keep track of their experiences.

Attraction Management: Attractions can be added with details like name, location, entry fee, and a rating system that reflects how well they're received by visitors.

Review System: Visitors can leave reviews for the attractions they've visited. Each review includes a score (1-5) and an optional comment. The system ensures that only visitors who have actually visited an attraction can leave a review, keeping the feedback genuine.

Rating Calculation: Once a review is submitted, the platform automatically updates the attraction's average rating based on all the reviews, allowing users to quickly spot the top-rated places.

Error Handling: The system is designed to ensure everything works smoothly, with built-in checks to prevent mistakes, like duplicate reviews or invalid inputs.

This project combines basic CRUD operations with smart logic to make sure only legitimate reviews are added, and attractionsâ€™ ratings are always up to date. It uses MongoDB and Mongoose to manage all the data behind the scenes.

Additinal Functionality: Someone who is no a user can't add a review.
